          Blockchain is a fantastic piece of technology that is changing the
          world as we know it. But everything comes at a cost. Crypto, as of
          today, has a significant layer of complexity that malicious people are
          trying to take advantage of by fooling you into a scam with the loss
          of your funds as a result.

          That's why I made this interactive application where you will learn
          everything about interacting with cryptocurrencies in an isolated
          environment. Discover adventures from beginner to expert, but watch
          out, don't get scammed!
